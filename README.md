# UnifyID_Challenge
Coding challenge for Unfiy ID.
Required to create an RGB bitmap picture using random numbers.
## Running The Server
    npm install
will install all required dependencies. You only need to do this once.
    
    npm start
will run the server on localhost:3000.
## Approach
### Back-End
Node.JS + Express.
### Front-End
The challenge could have been accomplished without a Node.js back-end, since
vanilla javascript (especially with jQuery) has the ability to make 
get requests. But since this is a full-stack challenge I implemented a
back-end nonetheless.
